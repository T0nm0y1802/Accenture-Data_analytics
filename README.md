# Accenture Virtual Intern Project - Data Cleaning, Modeling, and Analysis
## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Accenture Virtual Intern Project! This project involves data cleaning in Excel, data modeling, and analysis, culminating in a presentation created in PowerPoint. The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience in working with real-world data and applying data analysis techniques.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

**DataCleaning:** This directory contains the raw data and the Excel file used for data cleaning. The data cleaning process aimed to preprocess and prepare the data for subsequent analysis.

**DataModeling:** Here, you'll find the files related to the data modeling phase. This may include scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or any other tools used for modeling the data.

**DataAnalysis:** This section encompasses the analysis of the cleaned and modeled data. You'll find the scripts, code, or notebooks used for deriving insights from the data.

**Presentation:** The final presentation is stored in this directory. It consolidates the findings from the data analysis and presents them in a visually appealing manner using PowerPoint.
